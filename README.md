Introduction
This README provides a brief overview of the Cypress framework, a popular open-source end-to-end testing framework for modern web applications.

Key Features
Interactive Testing: Cypress provides a real-time browser preview while writing and running tests, allowing interactive debugging.

Automatic Waiting: Cypress automatically waits for elements to be available, making tests more reliable and resilient to flakiness.

Easy Setup: Cypress has a quick and easy setup process, making it convenient to get started with testing.

Cross-browser Testing: Cypress supports cross-browser testing on popular browsers like Chrome, Firefox, Edge, and more.

Snapshot and Video Recording: Cypress allows you to take snapshots and record videos during test execution for better analysis.

Prerequisites
Node.js and npm: Ensure you have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your machine. Download and install from the official Node.js website.
Getting Started
Initialize a Cypress Project: Create a new directory for your Cypress project and initialize it using npm:

bash
Copy code
mkdir my-cypress-project
cd my-cypress-project
npm init -y
Install Cypress: Install Cypress as a dev dependency in your project:

bash
Copy code
npm install cypress --save-dev
Open Cypress: Launch Cypress with the following command:

bash
Copy code
npx cypress open
Write and Run Tests: Write your tests in Cypress using its intuitive and powerful testing framework. Run tests interactively through the Cypress Test Runner.

Sample Cypress Test (example_spec.js)
javascript
Copy code
describe('Example Test', () => {
  it('should visit the home page', () => {
    cy.visit('https://example.com');
    cy.contains('Welcome to Example').should('be.visible');
  });
});
Running the Tests
Run the Cypress tests from the command line:

bash
Copy code
npx cypress run
Or run interactively with the Cypress Test Runner:

bash
Copy code
npx cypress open
